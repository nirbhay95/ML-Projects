Linear Regression ML Project -: Salary Prediction Respect to Work Experience

In this project, I developed a linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of work experience. The dataset consisted of two columns: one containing the independent variable (years of work experience) and the other containing the target variable (salary). My goal was to build an accurate predictive model that could estimate salaries based on an individual's years of experience.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

I performed comprehensive data preprocessing to handle outliers, missing values, and skewed distributions. This involved techniques such as outlier detection and removal, imputation of missing values, and log transformation of skewed features.
Statistical Analysis:

I conducted statistical analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distributions of the variables. This included calculating summary statistics, visualizing histograms and box plots, and identifying correlations between variables.
Visualization:

I visualized the relationship between years of work experience and salary using scatter plots and heatmaps. This allowed me to assess the linearity between variables and identify any potential patterns or trends.
Model Development:

Using Scikit-learn, I built a linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of work experience. I trained the model on a subset of the data and evaluated its performance using cross-validation techniques.
Model Evaluation:

I evaluated the performance of the linear regression model using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. This allowed me to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
Results:
The linear regression model achieved promising results, with an R-squared value of 0.97, indicating a strong correlation between years of work experience and salary.
The model demonstrated good predictive performance, with mean squared error and mean absolute error values of 3737, respectively.
Visualizations of the model predictions compared to actual salary values showed a close alignment, indicating that the model accurately captured the underlying relationship between years of experience and salary.
Conclusion:
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression for predicting salaries based on years of work experience. By leveraging statistical analysis, visualization techniques, and machine learning modeling, I was able to develop a robust predictive model that can be used to estimate salaries with high accuracy.
