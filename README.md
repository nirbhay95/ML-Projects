# ML-Projects
Welcome to the machine learning project repository made by me(Nirbhay Tiwari)! This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation for our machine learning project

Key Features:
Data Collection: We collected data from various sources (exp: kaggle) and performed data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables.
Model Development: We developed machine learning models using various supervised & unsupervised algorithms to predict [target variable or outcome].
Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of our models using various metrics such as accuracy, MSE, R2, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: We deployed the best-performing model as a REST API using Flask, making it accessible for real-world applications.

Repository Structure:
data/: Contains raw and processed datasets used in the project.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and analysis.
scripts/: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Contains serialized model files saved after training.
api/: Contains files for deploying the model as a REST API.
docs/: Contains project documentation, including project overview, data dictionaries, and model evaluation reports.
requirements.txt: Contains a list of Python dependencies required to run the code.
Usage:
To replicate our analysis and reproduce the results:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g., notebooks/ or scripts/) and run the desired scripts or notebooks.
For more detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation in the docs/ directory.
